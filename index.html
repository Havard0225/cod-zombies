            <p><span id="bold">Call of Duty: Zombies</span> is a popular game mode that debuted in Call of Duty: World at War (2008) and has since become a staple of the franchise. It features a cooperative survival gameplay experience, where players face off against waves of increasingly difficult zombie enemies. Over the years, the Zombies mode has expanded into its own unique storyline and lore, featuring distinct maps, characters, and settings. </p>

            <p>gameplay generally involves players fending off zombies while completing objectives, unlocking areas, and upgrading weapons. One of the key elements of the mode is the "perks" system, where players can drink special drinks that grant them abilities, like quicker reloads or more health. Players can also earn points by killing zombies, which they use to open doors, buy weapons, and upgrade equipment.</p>
